Multi-Objective Integer Programming with Gurobi and Python

The optimisation software from `Gurobi <https://www.gurobi.com/>`_ now supports `multi-objective programming <https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/9.5/refman/multiple_objectives.html>`_.

Since there are multiple objectives, there may be many solutions, each of which may optimise the objectives with a different set of priorities. Finding all such solutions can be algorithmically costly, so Gurobi's solver only returns a single result.

However, due to the importance of such functionality, much research has been invested into finding better algorithms that can efficiently find all solutions.

This python package extends Gurobi's multi-objective functionality by using the algorithms developed by (Ozlen et al., 2014) and (Tamby & Vanderpooten, 2020). It provides a module that can be used in python programs, as well as a command line tool that can read `multi-objective LP <https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/9.5/refman/lp_format.html>`_ files.

Many of the examples found in this project have been converted from the examples `shared by William Pettersson on figshare <https://figshare.com/authors/_/3770188>`_, which were used to benchmark the parallel processing algorithm described in (Pettersson & Ozlen, 2019).
